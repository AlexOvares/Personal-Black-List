# Personal Blacklist (PBL)

Tired of dealing with undesirable pugs? Have you ever joined a keystone, only to have a DPS leave half-way through the dungeon? Find yourself wishing you could avoid toxic people in battlegrounds? Then this addon is the perfect solution for you!

Personal Blacklist (PBL) is a lightweight addon that gives you the ability to store information about players you no longer wish to play with. In just a few clicks, you can add a player to your blacklist, along with a generic category and the reason you wish to avoid them, and you'll be immediately notified whenever they join a group you're in! Additionally, if a player is on your blacklist, you'll see information about their entry in that player's tooltip.


## Features

- Maintain a blacklist of undesirable players.
- See information about a blacklisted player in their tooltip(s).
- **Alert System**: Receive popups when blacklisted players join your groups.
- **Chat Filter:** Adds prefixes to chat messages from blacklisted players. (Thanks Pantyphoon!)

### Coming Soon

- Edit preexisting blacklist entries.
- More localization options. Spanish localization fixes.
- Blacklist backups.
- Show blacklist information in LFG tooltips.

## Usage

Simply toggle the PBL ui via its minimap button, or type `/pbl` in chat to open the main window.
