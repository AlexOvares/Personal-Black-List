# v3.7 Changelog
**New Feature: Editing**

**New Feature: Custom Notes**
* Want to give more context to a blacklisted player? Write a note and explain what happened!

**General Notes**
* Code Optimizations
* Removed class icons as they were offsetting rows and causing spacing issues.

**Discord Server**
* We now have a Discord server! If you're experiencing issues, have suggestions, or want to help out, feel free to join: [discord.gg/pugCR2Tutr](discord.gg/pugCR2Tutr)

**COMPATIBILITY NOTE**
* While this update has been tested with a few users who have preexisting data, and it has worked without issues, I cannot guarantee that every edge case has been covered. **Please back up your existing blacklist (``World of Warcraft\_retail_\WTF\Account\<Your Account>\SavedVariables\PersonalBlacklist.lua``) if you are at all concerned.**
